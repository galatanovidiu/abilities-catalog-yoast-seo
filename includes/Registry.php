/**
 * Discovers ability classes and registers them with the Abilities API.
 *
 * Discovery is convention-driven: the scan recurses through `includes/Abilities/`,
 * and every class implementing {@see Ability} is registered. Abilities are organized
 * into top-level groups (`Core`, and any add-on group such as `Woo`), each owning its
 * own {@see CategoryProvider}. There is no shared manifest and no shared category
 * file, so a contributor adds files only under their own group folder and never edits
 * a shared list — the safe shape for parallel fan-out.
 *
 * An annotation guard is enforced here as a hard gate: read-only abilities and
 * writes that explicitly declare a boolean `annotations.destructive` (true or
 * false) register; a write that OMITS the `destructive` annotation is treated as
 * unsafe and skipped with a `_doing_it_wrong()` notice. Destructive writes DO
 * register, but EXPOSURE to the browser is gated separately by the adapter: a
 * non-destructive write needs the write setting; a destructive write needs BOTH
 * the write setting and the destructive setting. Capability remains the hard
 * authorization guard in all cases.
 *
 * This gate enforces "annotations present", not a build tier: tier scope (e.g. T1
 * vs T2 writes) is bounded by which ability files are present, not by this guard.
