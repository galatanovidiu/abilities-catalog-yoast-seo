/**
 * An {@see Ability} that is only available under a runtime condition.
 *
 * Most abilities wrap WordPress core and are always available, so they implement
 * {@see Ability} directly. An ability that wraps an optional dependency — a
 * third-party plugin that may be inactive — implements this interface instead, so
 * the {@see \GalatanOvidiu\AbilitiesCatalogYoast\Registry} registers it ONLY when the
 * dependency is present. When {@see isAvailable()} returns false the ability does
 * not register at all: it is absent from the Abilities API, the dangerous-tools
 * map, and the screen-link map, rather than registering and then denying every
 * call. The capability check stays the hard guard on whatever does register.
 *
 * {@see isAvailable()} is evaluated at registration time (on
 * `wp_abilities_api_init` and when the consumer filters run), never at file load
 * or in the constructor, so the dependency's plugin has already loaded by the time
 * it is asked.
 *
 * @since 0.3.0
